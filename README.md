# [Three Practical Examples to Learn Laravel][published url]
## Instructor: [Jeremy McPeak][instructor url]


Laravel is the most popular PHP application framework, and there are countless tutorials, articles, and yes, even videos on how to get started with and learn Laravel. But this course is going to be a bit different: you're going to learn Laravel by building a series of practical applications that, with a little extra work, could be used in the real world.

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Jeremy McPeak will teach you the core concepts of writing Laravel applications. The first project will focus on Laravel's view engine: Blade. In the next project, you'll learn how to connect to a database in Laravel, with the Eloquent object-relational mapper and the Artisan tool for managing your database from the command-line. Finally, your final project will go further with Laravel and Eloquent: working with controllers, using Eloquent pagination, and authenticating users.
